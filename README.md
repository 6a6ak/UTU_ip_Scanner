# UTU_ip_Scanner
## Network Scanner with Bash and Nmap

This repository contains a simple Bash script that uses `nmap` to scan a given IP address range for online devices. It first checks if `nmap` is installed on your system and, if not, installs it for you. Then, it scans the network and lists the online devices.
